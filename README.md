2022 [Latinos in Tech Hackathon](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6965735462569205760?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6965735462569205760%29) Project, August 20 - 21

This was my first time working on a team and working to fulfill the needs of an actual client! The business owner is currently using Weebly to host their website, so this mock-up was not used, but instead, the Weebly account was updated. Regardless, I challenged myself to bring the Canva mockup to life via HTML and CSS, and it was excellent practice for me. This was a tremendous experience!
